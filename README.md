# Geoguessr-Distance-Royale-Cheat
A cheat for Geoguessr Distance Royale Cheat
U need to use tampermonkey extension with chrome. 
install the script to the extension using the tampermonkey website.
activate the script using the extension icon.
you have to refresh at the start of a new game
press alt+shift+f....... or g I forget, haha. 
Sometimes you have to wait a second for it to work.
There is also a potential you get shadowbanned from the API it uses 
(YOU WILL NOT GET BANNED FROM GEOGUESSER) 
using a VPN to change IPs will fix any issues there
If you get the alert box and it says "County: undefined" the API banned you and you need to change IPs.
This has something to do with post requests I think. 
Also, tempermonkey will ask you to allow the script to use get/post requests on the site (geoguessr)
allow it always and for all subdomains of geoguessr or it wont work
